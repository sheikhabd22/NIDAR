## **A. Mission Planning & KML Integration**

- [ ]  Parse KML file and extract area boundary coordinates
- [ ]  Convert KML coordinates to GPS/UTM for onboard processing
- [ ]  Implement geofence logic to prevent out-of-bounds flight
- [ ]  Auto-trigger Return-to-Home (RTH) on geofence breach
- [ ]  Validate geofence with simulated/test coordinates

---

## **B. Autonomous Navigation & Mapping**

- [ ]  Set up and optimize visual SLAM (e.g., ORB-SLAM3) for real-time mapping
- [ ]  Integrate GPS and IMU data for scale correction and robustness
- [ ]  Test SLAM accuracy and drift in controlled environments
- [ ]  Develop area coverage algorithm (lawnmower/spiral) for full scan within time limit
- [ ]  Integrate path planner with geofence and SLAM outputs

---

## **C. Computer Vision & Survivor Detection**

- [ ]  Select and optimize YOLO (or equivalent) model for aerial human detection
- [ ]  Collect/augment training data for rooftop human detection scenarios
- [ ]  Train and validate detection model; optimize for Raspberry Pi
- [ ]  Integrate detection pipeline with live camera feed
- [ ]  Fuse detection results with SLAM/GPS for geotagging survivors

---

## **D. Communication & Data Handling**

- [ ]  Set up LoRa module for telemetry and survivor geotag transmission
- [ ]  Define data packet structure and implement error handling
- [ ]  Integrate communication link with ground control station (GCS)
- [ ]  Ensure all mission data (status, location, detections) is reported to GCS

---

## **E. Ground Control Station (GCS) & Interface**

- [ ]  Develop interface to display real-time drone positions and survivor locations
- [ ]  Integrate mission status and command controls as per rulebook
- [ ]  Implement single interface for both drones to comply with competition rules
- [ ]  Test GCS with simulated mission data

---

## **F. Payload Delivery (Delivery Drone)**

- [ ]  Implement waypoint navigation to survivor coordinates
- [ ]  Integrate servo-based payload drop mechanism with flight controller
- [ ]  Confirm delivery via onboard sensors (e.g., camera, IMU)
- [ ]  Report delivery status to GCS

---

## **G. Safety, Compliance & Failsafes**

- [ ]  Implement RTH and battery failsafe logic
- [ ]  Test geofence and altitude breach responses
- [ ]  Log all mission-critical events for pre-flight inspection and review

---

## **H. Testing & Validation**

- [ ]  Unit test each subsystem (navigation, CV, comms, delivery)
- [ ]  Conduct integration testing on the full software stack
- [ ]  Perform field trials with mock survivors and KML boundaries
- [ ]  Track metrics: detection accuracy, mapping precision, delivery accuracy, system stability

---

## **I. Documentation & Reporting**

- [ ]  Document all APIs, algorithms, and system architecture
- [ ]  Maintain logs of tests, code changes, and hardware modifications
- [ ]  Prepare technical review and business pitch presentations as per competition deliverables
